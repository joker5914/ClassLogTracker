RaidRecon 📡
RaidRecon is your spy-themed WoW addon for TurtleWoW (1.12.1) that lets you eavesdrop on combat logs by class—so you can sniff out mistakes, interrupts, overheals and more in your party or raid.

🕵️‍♂️ Features
🔍 Class-filtered logs: one-click buttons to view only Warrior, Priest, Mage, etc.

🎨 Color-coded class buttons for instant recognition

🔀 Party/Raid switch: toggle between small-group and raid data

📜 Live scrolling output: real-time feed of the selected class’s spells, heals, auras and fades

📦 Minimal dependencies: uses Blizzard frames + LibAddonMenu-2.0 only

📌 Draggable & closable UI panel
